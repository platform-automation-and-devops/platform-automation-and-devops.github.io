# Challenge 2 - Toggle Resource Creation with Count üïπÔ∏è

[< Previous Challenge](./challenge1.md) | **[Home](./introduction.md)** | [Next Challenge >](./challenge3.md)

## Description

In this challenge, you‚Äôll use a variable as a toggle switch to control the creation of resources in Terraform. By combining conditional logic with the `count` meta-argument, you‚Äôll gain control over whether a specific resource is created based on a single setting.

## Success Criteria

1. [ ] Define a variable to act as a toggle for enabling or disabling a resource.
2. [ ] Set up a condition that will use this toggle to control the resource‚Äôs creation.
3. [ ] Configure the input of the `terraform_data` resource to display a message only when the toggle is enabled.
4. [ ] Test different toggle values and observe the resulting changes when applying the configuration.
