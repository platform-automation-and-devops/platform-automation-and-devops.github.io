# Challenge 1 - Ensuring Terraform Compatibility ⚙️

**[Home](./introduction.md)** | [Next Challenge >](./challenge2.md)

## Description

In this challenge, you’ll learn how to set up version requirements in Terraform. Previously, we had made use of the terraform_data resource, however this is only available in Terraform 1.4 and later versions. By setting a version requirement, you can ensure that your configuration is compatible with the version of Terraform you are using.

## Success Criteria

1. [ ] In a new directory, create a basic Terraform configuration file.
2. [ ] Define a section to set compatibility with a specific Terraform version or higher.
3. [ ] Initialize and test your setup to confirm that the version check works as expected.
