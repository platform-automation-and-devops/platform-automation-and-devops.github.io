# Week 1 - Introduction to Bicep

## Introduction 

This hack week is designed to introduce you to Bicep, a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for deploying Azure resources declaratively.

Bicep is a language that greatly simplifies the authoring experience with a cleaner syntax and better support for modularity and code re-use.  It is a transparent abstraction over ARM and ARM templates, which means anything you can do in an ARM template, you can do in Bicep.

## Prerequisites

- A powershell or CLI environment configured with Bicep (see challenge 1)
- Bicep extension installed in VSCode (see challenge 1)

## Challenges 

### [Challenge 1 - Environment Setup](challenge1.md)

### [Challenge 2 - Logging into Azure](challenge2.md)

### [Challenge 3 - Understanding a Bicep File](challenge3.md)

### [Challenge 4 - Deploy a simple Bicep file](challenge4.md)
