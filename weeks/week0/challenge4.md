[< Previous Challenge](./challenge3.md) | **[Home](./introduction.md)**

## Description

In this challenge, you are tasked with setting up your development environment for a project that involves infrastructure as code (IaC) using Terraform and Azure. The goal is to ensure you have all the necessary tools installed on your machine to manage and deploy resources in Azure. This includes the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) editor for writing and managing your code, Terraform for defining and provisioning infrastructure through code, and the Azure CLI (Command Line Interface) for managing Azure services directly from the terminal. Successfully completing this setup is crucial for streamlining your development workflow and enabling efficient management of cloud resources.
