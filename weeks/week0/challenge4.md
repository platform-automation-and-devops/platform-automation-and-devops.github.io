[< Previous Challenge](./challenge3.md) | **[Home](./introduction.md)** | [Next Challenge >](./challenge5.md)

## Description

In this challenge, you are tasked with setting up your development environment for a project that involves infrastructure as code (IaC) using Terraform and Azure. The goal is to ensure you have all the necessary tools installed on your machine to manage and deploy resources in Azure. This includes the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) editor for writing and managing your code, Terraform for defining and provisioning infrastructure through code, and the Azure CLI (Command Line Interface) for managing Azure services directly from the terminal. Successfully completing this setup is crucial for streamlining your development workflow and enabling efficient management of cloud resources.

## Success Criteria

1. [ ] You have downloaded VsCode.
2. [ ] You have downloaded Git.
3. [ ] You have downloaded Terraform.
4. [ ] You have downloaded AZ CLI.
5. [ ] Run `code --version; terraform --version; az --version; git version` in the Windows Powershell Terminal with successful exit code
6. [ ] You have created a new folder `C:\Users\<Username>\Code` on your machine to store your code for this series.
