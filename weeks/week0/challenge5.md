# Challenge 5 - Bonus: Develop with Docker 🐳

[< Previous Challenge](./challenge4.md) | **[Home](./introduction.md)**

## Description

In this bonus challenge, you will consolidate all the tools you installed in previous challenges into a single, efficient development environment using Docker. By creating a development container, you can ensure a consistent setup across different machines, simplify dependency management, and improve overall workflow efficiency. Instead of installing tools directly on your local machine, you will leverage Docker to encapsulate your development environment, making it portable and easier to manage.

## Success Criteria

1. Install WSL 2.
2. Set up Docker Desktop with WSL 2 integration.
3. Create a development container using a `devcontainer.json` file that includes all the tools you used in previous challenges.
4. Ensure the container runs smoothly and all tools are accessible within the container.
